title: "Synchronous Extraction"
---

Synchronous extraction processes a document in a single request–response cycle. The connection remains open until the extraction process completes and the full response is returned.

This mode is best suited for:

- Smaller documents
- Interactive or real-time use cases
- Scenarios where immediate results are required

**Key characteristics**

- Single request / single response
- Subject to a maximum timeout of **300 seconds**

If the extraction does not complete within the timeout window, the request will fail and should be retried using asynchronous extraction.

> **Tip:** Use asynchronous extraction for large files or when processing time is unpredictable.
