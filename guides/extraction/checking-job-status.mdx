title: "Checking Job Status"
---

When using asynchronous extraction, you must poll the job status endpoint to monitor progress and retrieve results once processing is complete.

### Job lifecycle

Each asynchronous job progresses through a series of states:

| Status       | Meaning                                                                        |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `processing` | The job is still being processed. Continue polling at your preferred interval. |
| `completed`  | The job has finished successfully and extraction results are available.        |
| `failed`     | The job failed due to an error. Error details may be included in the response. |
| `expired`    | The job data is no longer available.                                           |

### Job retention & polling rules

- A job’s GUID remains valid for **7 days** from creation.
- Once a job has **completed or failed**:
  - Extracted data (or error details) is available for **12 hours**.
  - After the **first poll** following completion or failure, the data remains available for **15 minutes**.
  - You may poll the job **up to 3 times**, with each poll resetting the 15-minute timer.

After either:

- The third poll, or
- 15 minutes passing without another poll

the following occurs:

- Extracted data or error details are permanently deleted
- Job status changes to `expired`
- The GUID and final status remain available for the remainder of the 7-day retention period

> **Best practice:** Poll only when needed and persist results immediately after retrieval.
