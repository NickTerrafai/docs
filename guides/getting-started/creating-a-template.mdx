Templates are a core part of the document extraction process. They define **what information the system should extract** from a document and **how that information should be structured** in the final output.

A template is essentially a list of fields written in natural language that tells the system what to look for (for example, _invoice number_ or _total amount_).

# Field Names

Field names are required for every piece of information you want to extract from a document.

When defining field names, simply think about the data you want to capture. For example, when extracting data from an invoice, you might start with:

- Invoice number
- Invoice date
- Invoice total

**Naming Rules:**

- Field names **cannot contain spaces**.
- If you type a field name with spaces, the system will automatically replace them with underscores.
  - Example: `Invoice Number` → `Invoice_Number`

Field names should be **clear and descriptive**, as they become the keys in the extracted output.

# Data Types

Data types tell the system **how to interpret, format, and structure** the extracted information. Choosing the correct data type improves accuracy and enables advanced features such as line items and nested fields.

**Supported Data Types:**

| Date Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text               | Use for standard text fields such as names, addresses, or descriptions.                                                                                       |
| Whole Numbers      | Use for numbers without decimal places (e.g., quantities, counts).                                                                                            |
| Decimal Numbers    | Use for numbers that include decimal values (e.g., prices, totals).                                                                                           |
| True/False         | A boolean field. Use **Rules **to clearly define when the value should be set to `true` or `false`.                                                           |
| Date               | Automatically extracts dates and formats them as `YYYY/MM/DD`. If you need a different format, use the **Text** data type and specify the format in the rules |
| List of Fields     | Used to extract repeating data such as line items (explained below).                                                                                          |
| Section / Group    | Used to logically group related fields together (explained below).                                                                                            |
| Choose from a List | Forces the system to select a value from a predefined list (enumeration).                                                                                     |

<Accordion title="List of Fields (Line Items)" icon="sparkles">
  The **List of Fields** data type is used when the same set of information repeats multiple times in a document, such as invoice line items.

  When you change a field’s data type to **List of Fields**:

  - A first subfield is automatically created
  - An **Add Subfield** button appears

  Think of subfields as **column names** for each line item. For example, an invoice line item list might include:

  - Item description
  - Quantity
  - Unit price
  - Line total

  **Nested Line Items:**

  - A subfield can also be set to **List of Fields**, allowing line items within line items.
  - The system supports **up to 2 levels of depth** for nested lists.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Section / Group" icon="sparkles">
  **Sections / Groups** allow you to organize related fields under a single parent field.

  They work similarly to **List of Fields**, with one key difference:

  - **Subfields in a section do not repeat**
  - They simply store child fields that logically belong together

  **Example Use Cases:**

  - Grouping billing address fields
  - Grouping payment details
  - Grouping vendor or customer information

  **Nesting Rules:**

  - A **Section / Group** can contain:
    - Text fields
    - A **List of Fields**
    - Another **Section / Group**
  - You are limited to **2 levels of nesting** in total.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Choose from a List" icon="sparkles">
  The **Choose from a List** data type restricts the extracted value to a predefined set of options. This is effectively an **enumeration**.

  Use this when the output should always be one of a known set of values, such as:

  - Payment method: `Credit Card`, `Bank Transfer`, `Cash`
  - Document type: `Invoice`, `Receipt`, `Purchase Order`

  This helps enforce consistency and prevents unexpected outputs.

# Description

The **Description** field helps the system **locate the correct information** in the document when it is unclear or poorly labeled.

Use the description to explain:

- Where the information appears in the document
- What the information looks like
- How it is labeled (or mislabeled)

**Guidelines:**

- Descriptions are **optional**
- It is recommended to **leave this empty unless the system struggles**
- Overusing descriptions can reduce flexibility

# Rules

Rules describe **what the system should do with the extracted information before returning it**.

While descriptions answer:

> “Help me find this information”

Rules answer:

> “What should I do with this information once I find it?”

Rules are written in natural language and can be used to:

- Transform values
- Split combined fields
- Normalize formats
- Apply logic (e.g., when to set a boolean value)

**Example Use Case:**xample Use Case

In one example, a document contained a single column labeled **Description** that included both:

- The item name
- The item dimensions

Using **Rules**, the system was instructed to:

- Separate the item description from the dimensions
- Store each value in its own field during extraction
