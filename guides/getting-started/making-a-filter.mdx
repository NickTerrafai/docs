Filters allow you to **classify, route, or skip documents** before extraction. They are designed for workflows where you send **multiple document types** into the system and need to:

- Apply **different templates** to different document types
- Automatically **skip unsupported documents**
- **Reduce consumption fees** by avoiding unnecessary extraction

When using filters, you **do not need to explicitly specify a template** at extraction. The filter evaluates each document and automatically decides:

- Whether the document should be extracted
- Which template will be used

## How Filters Work

A filter is a **set of rules** that define how the system should classify incoming documents.

Each rule represents **one possible decision** the system can make based on the content and appearance of a document.

### Key Requirements

- You must create **at least one template** before creating a filter
- Each document is evaluated against the filter rules
- Each rule is evaluated independently

## Rule Configuration

<Accordion title="Document Name" icon="sparkles">
  The **Document Name** is a label assigned to a rule when it matches a document.

  - It does **not** need to match the template name
  - It does **not** need to reflect the actual document type
  - It is used purely as an **identifier in the output**

  **Requirements**

  - This field is **mandatory**
  - Every rule must have a Document Name
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Document Description" icon="sparkles">
  The **Document Description** defines what the document looks like and is used by the system to distinguish between document types.

  This description can be based on:

  - Visual layout (tables, headers, logos)
  - Common phrases or keywords
  - Document structure
  - Formatting or content patterns

  **Guidelines**

  - This field is **mandatory**
  - Be as specific as possible
  - Descriptions can reference both visual and written attributes
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extract" icon="sparkles">
  The **Extract** option controls whether documents matching this rule should be processed or skipped.

  - **Enabled**:
    - The document will be extracted
    - You must select a template
    - Consumption fees apply
  - **Disabled**:
    - The document will be skipped
    - No extraction occurs
    - No consumption fees are applied

  This is especially useful for ignoring:

  - Unsupported document types
  - Irrelevant attachments
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Template" icon="sparkles">
  The **Template** field specifies which template should be used when extraction is enabled.

  - This field is required **only if Extract is enabled**
  - The selected template determines:
    - Which fields are extracted
    - How the data is structured in the output

  If Extract is disabled, no template selection is required.
</Accordion>

## Best Practices

- Place **more specific rules first** and general rules later
- Always include a **final catch-all rule** to handle unexpected documents
- Use filters to control costs by skipping irrelevant documents
- Keep document descriptions focused and unambiguous

<Accordion title="Example Filter" icon="sparkles">
  The example filter below contains **three rules**:

  1. **Invoice Rule**\
     Any document that looks like an invoice is:
     - Labeled as an invoice
     - Extracted using the Invoice template
  2. **Bank Statement Rule**\
     Any document that looks like a bank statement is:
     - Labeled as a bank statement
     - Extracted using the Bank Statement template
  3. **Catch-All Rule**\
     Any document that is **not** an invoice or bank statement:
     - Is skipped
     - Is not extracted
     - Does not incur any consumption fees

  Each row in the filter represents **one rule**.
