title: "Making a Request"
---

To check the status of an asynchronous job, send a request to the checkStatus endpoint, including the GUID you received from the extractFieldsAsync response.

```
 https://smartsense-dev-api.nostello.com/api/v1/checkStatus/[guid]
```

A job’s **GUID** remains valid for 7 days from creation. Once the job has completed or failed:

- The extracted data (or error details) will be available for **12 hours**.
- After your **first poll** following completion or failure, the data remains available for **15 minutes**.
- You may poll **up to 3 times**, with each poll resetting the 15-minute timer.

After the **third poll**, or when the 15-minute window expires without another poll:

- The extracted data or error details are permanently deleted.
- The job status changes to **expired**, but the GUID and final status remain available for the remainder of the 7-day retention period.
