## Asynchronous Extraction

You can use the asynchronous endpoint to extract documents asynchronously. A GUID will be returned and the connection closed. You will then have to poll the Check Status endpoint to receive the document extraction data.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Template Name" icon="sparkles">

<Accordion title="Document Splitting" icon="sparkles">

  The setting is toggled on and off by specifying "true" or "false" in the request body. Please note that if document splitting is not specified it will **default to "false" off**.

  | **Key**           | **Type** | **Value**  |
  | :---------------- | :------- | :--------- |
  | documentSplitting | Text     | true/false |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Returning Documents" icon="sparkles">
  You can use the returning documents parameter when you would like to return the file for each extracted document as a Base64-encoded PDF. This is convenient to use in combination with document splitting if you would like to store the seperated PDF file.

  The setting is toggled on and off by specifying "true" or "false" in the request body. Please note that if return documents is not specified it will **default to "false" off**.

<Accordion title="Returning Text" icon="sparkles">
  The returning text parameters allows the ability to return all of the text extracted from the document as a single text blob for storage and indexing if required.

  The setting is toggled on and off by specifying "true" or "false" in the request body. Please note that if return text is not specified it will **default to "false" off**.

  | Key        | Type | Value      |
  | :--------- | :--- | :--------- |
  | returnText | Text | true/false |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Schema Chunking" icon="sparkles">
  Schema chunking (to be renamed template chunking) should generally be kept set to Auto. In this mode, the system extracts individual line items on a per-page basis, allowing documents with line items to be effectively unlimited in length.

  However, each individual line item must exist entirely within a single page. If the data for a single line item spans more than one page, schema chunking must be changed to Combined.

  Note that using "combined" chunking limits the total number of line items that can be extracted.

  If schemaChunking is not included the request, the system will **automatically set it to “auto”**.

  | **Key**        | **Type** | **Value**     |
  | :------------- | :------- | :------------ |
  | schemaChunking | Text     | auto/combined |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Password" icon="sparkles">
  If you need to extract password protected documents, the system can handle this. Simple insert the password in the request and it will extract the document using the password.

  | Key      | Type | Value      |
  | :------- | :--- | :--------- |
  | password | Text | [password] |
</Accordion>
