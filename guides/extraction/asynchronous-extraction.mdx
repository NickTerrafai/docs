title: "Asynchronous Extraction"
---

Asynchronous extraction allows documents to be processed in the background. When a request is submitted, the system immediately returns a unique job identifier (GUID) and closes the connection.

This mode is recommended for:

- Large or complex documents
- Batch processing
- Workloads where extraction time may exceed synchronous limits

**How it works**

1. An extraction job is created
2. A GUID is returned immediately
3. Processing continues in the background
4. Results are retrieved by polling the job status endpoint

The returned GUID is required to track progress and retrieve extraction results.
