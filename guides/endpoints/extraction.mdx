## Synchronous Extraction

When making a synchronous request, the connection remains open for until the extraction process is completed, and you receive the fill response on a single request/response cycle.

The timeout for a synchronous request is **300 seconds**.

## Asynchronous Extraction

You can use the asynchronous endpoint to extract documents asynchronously. A GUID will be returned and the connection closed. You will then have to poll the Check Status endpoint to receive the document extraction data.
